        "1. **Load and Preprocess PDF:** Extract text, create chunks, and prepare for processing.\n",
        "2. **Clean and Summarize Chunks:** Refine extracted text using the Llama model with custom prompts.\n",
        "3. **Generate Podcast Script:** Craft a dialogue between two speakers based on the processed data.\n",
        "4. **Make Script Dramatic:** Add impressions and enhance the engagement of the script.\n",
        "5. **Convert Script to Audio:** Use text-to-speech models (Parler-TTS, Bark) to generate audio.\n",

        "- **Extract text from PDF:** Using PyPDF2, extract the raw text from the input PDF file.\n",
        "- **Create chunks:** Divide the extracted text into smaller chunks for easier processing.\n",
