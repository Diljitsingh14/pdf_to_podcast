This paper presents a comprehensive survey of Knowledge Distillation's role within the realm of Large Language Models, highlighting its critical function in imparting advanced capabilities from leading proprietary models to open-source counterparts.
Advanced knowledge transfer to smaller models and its utility in model compression and self-improvement. Our survey is structured around three pillars: algorithm, skill, and verticalization, providing a comprehensive examination of knowledge distillation mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities, and their practical implications across diverse fields.
By bridging the gap between proprietary and open-source large language models, this survey highlights the potential for more accessible, efficient, and powerful AI solutions. We advocate for compliance with legal terms that regulate the use of large language models, ensuring ethical and lawful application.
LLMs have unlocked new realms of possibility, from generating human-like text to offering sophisticated problem-solving capabilities. Their emergent abilities enable them to tackle a diverse array of tasks with remarkable proficiency. These models excel in understanding and generation, driving applications from creative generation to complex problem-solving. The potential of these models extends far beyond current applications, promising to revolutionize industries, augment human creativity,
Redefine our interaction with technology. Despite the capabilities of proprietary LLMs, they have limitations, particularly when compared to open-source models. A significant drawback is limited accessibility and higher cost. These models often come with fees and restricted access, making them less attainable for individuals and smaller organizations. Using these models also raises concerns about data privacy and security, especially for users handling confidential information. Additionally, proprietary LLMs may not always align with the specific needs of niche applications.
Open-source language models like LLaMA and Mistral bring several advantages over proprietary ones. One of the primary benefits is their accessibility and adaptability. Without licensing fees or restrictive usage policies, these models are more readily available to a broader range of users. This openness fosters a collaborative and inclusive AI research environment, encouraging innovation and diverse applications. Additionally, the customizable nature of open-source LLMs allows for more tailored solutions, addressing specific needs that generic models may not meet.
One of the most significant limitations of open-source language models is their smaller model scale, which often results in lower performance on real-world tasks. These models may struggle to capture the depth and breadth of knowledge embodied in larger models. Additionally, the pre-training investment in these models is typically less substantial, leading to a narrower range of pre-training data and potentially limiting the models' understanding of diverse or specialized topics. Open-source models also often undergo fewer fine-tuning steps due to resource constraints, which can hinder their effectiveness in specialized applications.
particularly evident when these models are compared to highly fine-tuned proprietary LLMs, which excel in complex scenarios. Recognizing the disparities between proprietary and open-source LLMs, knowledge distillation techniques have surged to bridge the performance gap between these models. Knowledge distillation involves leveraging the advanced capabilities of leading proprietary models to enhance the competencies of open-source LLMs. This process is akin to transferring knowledge from a highly skilled teacher to a student, where the student learns to mimic the performance characteristics of the teacher.
Knowledge distillation is a paradigm to achieve knowledge distillation of large language models (LLMs), where a small seed of knowledge is used to prompt the LLM to generate more data with respect to a specific skill or domain. Additionally, knowledge distillation still retains its fundamental role in compressing LLMs, making them more efficient without significant loss in performance.
Compression for efficiency, emerging trends of self-improvement, and improving alignment with user intents are crucial for LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks. These tasks include casual conversations and complex problem-solving in specialized domains. For example, in healthcare, law, and science, accuracy and context-specific knowledge are essential, and knowledge distillation allows open-source models to significantly improve their performance by learning from proprietary models.
